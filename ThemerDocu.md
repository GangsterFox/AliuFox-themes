<h1 align="center">Light mode theming</h1>

* The way to theme in light mode is to find as many strings which have the word "light". This means for example if you find primary_light, that means you found a light mode string.
* This might be quite weird to do since this is some territory no one has really tried yet. Bare in mind this might not work on plugin but dont take my word.
* When you try to theme in light mode, at least with primary colors, try to use the same strings as written in the docu but try to add the _light string. 
* **Always** search before you do anything to find strings.
* This means that if you will try theming in light mode, just try to add _light to the string
* And as always, Good luck
*this will get updated when I will found out more.*
