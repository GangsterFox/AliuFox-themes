this is a docu for dark mode theming, be welcome to add things to the docu! I would be really happy

brand colors aka. accent colors 

brand up to 900 = old brand colors, are not used anymore so they are useless
brand_new up to 900 = new brand colors 
brand_new = accent color
brand_new 230 to 630 = accent colors for buttons, bot tags, on/off sliders blah blah
brand_new_560 = change the reaction clicked border 
link = literally just link colors and mention color

primary colors, used for the big things like chat bg, server list, member list, etc

primary_600 = server folders and something else I have no idea xdddd
primary_700 = spoilers,emebeds,top bar, DMs Button, bg for pings and server streaming icons (in plugin only changes the DMs button and also top bar)
primary_dark_600 = main chat bg and also somehow changes the member list bg
primary_630 = channel header and a lot of other stuff(use primary_dark_630 since it somehow changes all of this stuff too in plugin)
primary_dark_400 = changes the text "Message #..." color and also timestamp color
primary_dark_660 = color for the chat bar where you write your messages, also changes the icon bg for gifts and attachment  
primary_dark_800 = color for the bottom bar in the channel list, where the icons for friends, search, mentions, etc is
primary_dark_630 = server channels and channel header in member list
primary_dark_700 = server list
primary_800 = file select tab thing where you can choose from images, files, photots or go back to keyboard

small uikit things which are really really useful

uikit_btn_bg_color_selector_brand = changes buttons in general so send button for example

drawable things which are neat if I remember

drawable_button_grey = unread messages button
item_background_material = mostly used for the top bar(where the name of the plguin, version and author name is written)
design_bottom_navigation_item_background = is used mostly for the bottom part for plugin page(where description is, uninstall and settings) also themes search box in plugins page
ic_channel_text = by the name it changes the channel text in the channel list, since it doesnt get themed it will only theme the # in the channel list, top bar when looking in chat and in member list
drawable_button_red = the red NEWâ†‘ in the guild list when you get a ping in a guild
drawable_button_red_neutral = I actually have no idea what it does, if you find anything please tell me, thanks.

this link is mostly useless but can be of some help maybe in the future or if you understand it correctly you can find a lot of things to find in this gist
